# malware
This contains a code of a malware(trojan) which will try to establish connections to my server remotely


                   ****************************************  PRE-REQUISITES  ****************************************
Need to have a server which provide a machine(platfrom as a service - PASS) (like AWS or Google cloud). One can access their machines in free tier mode but
need to have an international credit/debit card to register (I have used AWS)

Basic knowledge of reverse shell
knowledge of java to built the apk(I have used chaquopy plugin which is used to run python codes using java)


                   ****************************************  What I will make  ****************************************
This is a malware code which is integrated with java code to make an apk(for >= android 11).

                  ****************************************  SETUP  ****************************************
I have registered in aws server and opened an Debain machine EC2 instance in aws server an the IP which I got, I have used here in the code.

When an user will run this apk(for now I have not provided any UI as I don't have any interest in frontend), it will connect with my netcat listener
which I will start prior to running the apk. This is not a professional way obviously but, if someone wants to make it professionally he has to host a server 24/7 which will cost him.

After I got the shell I can transfer files or pictures (if the android device is rooted I will gain access as a superuser,else if the phone is non-rooted, the shell 
which I will get will be restricted, so I cannot install/delete any modules) but I can transfer images and videos from the android's shell to my device.

                   ****************************************  Drawback  ****************************************
This project can be made professional by hoisting a 24/7 server and also need to add some UI to social engineer the users of the apk.

One drawback is that in current android devices apks need to ask permissions from the users(like we get allow/not allow) to run in background like media player apks.But it can be
compensated by social engineering which can be used in the apk to make users give permissions to run in background.
